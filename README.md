### File Descriptions:

#### `db_gen.py`:
- **Description**: This Python script is responsible for generating a database for speech-related tasks by processing audio files and associated labels.
- **Key Features**:
  - Reads label files and audio files from specified paths.
  - Separates speech and noise segments from the data.
  - Augments the data by randomly combining speech and noise segments.
  - Calculates the root mean square (RMS) values and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for audio segments.
  - Writes the generated data to RTTM (Rich Transcription Time Marked) files and creates corresponding WAV audio files.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `numpy`, `soundfile`, `audio2numpy`, `yaml`, `librosa`
- **Usage**:
  - Ensure the existence of a YAML configuration file (`db_gen.yaml`) with appropriate parameters.
  - Execute the script to generate the database by instantiating and calling the `DataBaseGenerator` class.

#### `db_gen.yaml`:
- **Description**: This YAML configuration file contains parameters used by the `db_gen.py` script for database generation.
- **Parameters**:
  - `db_address`: The address of the database directory.
  - `sr`: Sampling rate for audio files.
  - `file_name`: Prefix for generated files.
  - `num_sample`: Number of samples to generate.
  - `new_db_name`: Name for the new database.
  - `len_sample`: Length of the sample in seconds.

#### `MixHeadset.train.rttm`:
- **Description**: An output file containing RTTM data generated during the execution of the `db_gen.py` script.
- **Usage**: This file can be used for further processing or analysis of the generated database.

### Usage Instructions:
1. Ensure that the required dependencies (`numpy`, `soundfile`, `audio2numpy`, `yaml`, `librosa`) are installed.
2. Configure parameters in the `db_gen.yaml` file according to your requirements.
3. Execute the `db_gen.py` script to generate the database by running `python db_gen.py`.
4. Monitor the progress and check for any generated output files or logs as specified in the script.

### Note:
- This script is designed for generating speech-related databases and may require customization for other use cases.
- Make sure to review and adjust the parameters and configurations according to your specific needs before running the script.
